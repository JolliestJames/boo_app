BooApp

This [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies) application is the front end of a whole solution that lets me and my wife share photos of our life together.

# Development

```
git clone git@github.com:JolliestJames/boo_app.git
```

Install dependencies with the following commands:

```
