BooApp

This [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies) application is the front end of a whole solution that lets me and my wife share photos of our life together.

# Development

To get started, install dependencies with the following commands:

```
brew install node
brew install watchman
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

To run the app in an iOS simulator, run the following command:

```
react-native run-ios
```
